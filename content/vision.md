We thrive to build a comprehensive, transparent & open ecosystem with ‍all information of the beans as core - we call it the BEAN-DNA.
Besides this transparency, we want to give you all necessary instruments to perfect your own brewing process! Customize the app as you need it and always have access to your perfect settings - repeatable, customizable & open-source.


__Made-in-Germany__  
We are a team from Germany and thrive to use GDPR compliant tools hosted in Germany.

__Data security__  
We promise that all data we track will be secure and only used for our business-related purposes. See what we track, how, why and what we do with it.

__100% transparency__  
We want to be 100% transparent, both with the running costs, the data we track & source code.

__Open Source__  
We don't only promise - no, we prove that. Check the source code to see for yourself what we do.

__Flexible & versatile__  
We try to create an app that is for all types of coffee lovers and brew methods. Configure it like YOU need it.

__Added value__  
We always challenge ourself to check if the features are a benefit and make your brew logging easier or not.
